## Getting Started

[Getting Started](./Tutorials/Get_Started.md)

This documentation is about installing AWS tools and configuring AWS environment to download LADI dataset and load dataset in Python locally and remotely.

## Clean and Validate LADI Dataset

[Clean and Validate LADI Dataset](./Tutorials/Clean_Validate.md)

This documentation is about clean the LADI dataset. For this project, we have only extracted 2000 images for training.

## PyTorch Data Loading

[PyTorch Data Loading](./Tutorials/Pytorch_Data_Load.md)

This documentation is about loading LADI dataset in PyTorch framework including examples of writing custom `Dataset`, `Transforms` and `Dataloader`.

## Train and Test A Classifier

[Train and Test A Classifier](./Tutorials/Train_Test_Classifier.md)

This documentation is about training and testing a classifier model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch.

## Fine Tuning Torchvision Models

[Fine Tuning Torchvision Models](./Tutorials/Fine_Tune_Torchvision_Models.md)

This documentation is about training and testing a classifier model using pre-trained ResNet and AlexNet.
